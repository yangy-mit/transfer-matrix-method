# transfer-matrix-method
Function handles for Transfer Matrix Method (TMM) to perform electromagnetic analysis of multilayer media.

Both TE and TM polarizations are considered. 

The refractive index can be complex (materials with loss or gain). For example, `n = 1 + i` corresponds to a material with loss, and `n = 1 - i` corresponds to a material with gain.
